I need you to implement Phase 1 (MVP) of the CLI for the /later project following the implementation plan.

**Project Context:**
- Repository: https://github.com/chudeemeke/later
- This is a deferred decision management tool with a production MCP server (V1.0.0)
- The CLI will be a thin client that delegates 100% to the existing MCP server
- No business logic duplication - CLI is pure adapter

**Implementation Plan:**
Read the complete plan here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chudeemeke/later/main/docs/cli/implementation-plan.md

**Project Guidelines:**
Read the project CLAUDE.md for WoW compliance:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chudeemeke/later/main/CLAUDE.md

**Phase 1 MVP Scope (1-2 days):**
Implement the following with minimal features:

1. Basic MCP client (`src/cli/mcp-client.ts`)
   - Spawn MCP server via stdio
   - JSON-RPC communication
   - Basic error handling

2. Basic argument parser (`src/cli/parser.ts`)
   - Manual argv parsing
   - Extract subcommand and args
   - No validation yet

3. Three command handlers (`src/cli/commands/`):
   - `capture.ts` - Capture decision (decision text only, no context/tags/priority)
   - `list.ts` - List all items (no filters)
   - `show.ts` - Show item by ID

4. Main CLI entry point (`src/cli/cli.ts`)
   - Route to command handlers
   - Basic error handling
   - Exit codes

5. Executable setup (`bin/later`)
   - Node shebang
   - Require compiled CLI

6. Basic output formatter (`src/cli/output/formatter.ts`)
   - Plain text output (no tables/colors yet)
   - Success messages
   - Simple item display

**Deliverables:**
- Working: `later capture "text"`, `later list`, `later show 5`
- No help system yet (Phase 2)
- No flags/options yet (Phase 2)
- No pretty output yet (Phase 3)

**Critical Constraints:**
- MUST follow thin client pattern (zero business logic in CLI)
- MUST use TypeScript (matches MCP server)
- MUST follow WoW file structure (src/cli/, tests/cli/)
- MUST delegate 100% to MCP server via McpClient
- MUST NOT import src/storage/, src/validation/, or src/tools/

**Testing:**
Write basic integration tests to verify:
- CLI can spawn MCP server
- Commands execute successfully
- Output is displayed correctly

**Start by:**
1. Reading the implementation plan thoroughly
2. Creating directory structure (src/cli/, tests/cli/, bin/)
3. Implementing McpClient first (foundation)
4. Then parser, then command handlers
5. Finally, wire everything together in cli.ts

Please follow TDD where practical and ensure all code follows the patterns documented in the implementation plan.

When ready, start with: "I'll implement Phase 1 (MVP) of the CLI following the plan..."
